PYTHON BENCHMARK
WEDNESDAY 30 OCTOBER 2019
Goal
To create a terminal based application in python to buy tickets from "The Jefferson" music venue.

App Requirements
The user should only be able to buy a maximum of four tickets to shows that are not sold out
The shows.json file should update with the number of tickets sold after each transaction
Each check-in is logged in the transactions.txt file following the same format as the existing logs
No modifications to the shape of the data file
All inputs should have reasonable validation
Passing & Completion Notes
A student passes the benchmark if....

a user is able to buy a single ticket to a show that is not sold out, log the transaction, and save the show data
the application is easy to use and understand
the application is all dynamically loaded (i.e. no hard coding), has basic input validation, and the code is well organized
runs without error
A student completes this benchmark if...

all the conditions above are met
the user is able to buy multiple tickets (no more than four) without exceeding the number of tickets left available
the code is very well organized and extracted into purposeful functions
implements some UX features to improve the design and make the information easier to understand
the ticket.txt file is saved with the most recent ticket purchased (retaining the same formatting, hint: ''.center(40, ' '))
Clarification: 'tickets' in the data refers to the number of tickets remaining.
